# Security Policy for uYouPlus Developers
If I verify a reported security vulnerability, my policy is:

- the Contributors are allowed to patch only the **main** branch unless an additional branch is involved. implementation of anything like custom features/options, updated features/options, Grammer Errors.

- uYouPlusExtra doesn't support Localization pull requests. this may be a sudden change but its pretty hard to maintain the the localization whenever the branch resets. so therefore its hard to keep any localization changed on uYouPlusExtra.

## Supported Versions

these versions of the project are
currently being supported with security/feature updates.

| Version | LTS Support of the uYouPlusExtra Tweak | YT Version Supported by Google | App Stability        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| [latest](https://github.com/arichorn/uYouPlusExtra/releases/latest) | ✅ | ✅ | The latest version is stable! |
| [18.08.1-3.0.1 LTS](https://github.com/arichorn/uYouPlusExtra/releases/tag/v18.08.1-3.0.1-F3) | N/A | ✅ | This new LTS Release is new and is important to some uYou 3.0.1 Users. |
| [17.38.10-2.1 LTS](https://github.com/arichorn/uYouPlusExtra/releases/latest) | N/A | ✅ | This new LTS Release will soon to replace **16.42.3-2.1** next year. |
| [16.42.3-2.1 LTS](https://github.com/arichorn/uYouPlusExtra/releases/tag/v16.42.3-2.1-F20) | Depends | ✅ until 2024+ | Unstable if you are using iOS 16 or later, Stage Manager will not be sized correctly with any videos that are playing in the video player, The App Pivot Bar does not hide correctly when playing videos in iOS 16+ due to Old APIs or something else in the App but this version can still get new features from Google like these new ones that were recently added in as an example --> (Shorts, Continue Watching Section, Watch It Again Section, Handles & etc.) so overrall this YouTube Version is still supported by Google. |
