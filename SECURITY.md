| [16.42.3-2.1 LTS](https://github.com/arichorn/uYouPlusExtra/releases/tag/v16.42.3-2.1-F20) | Depends | ✅ until 2024+ | Unstable if you are using iOS 16 or later, Stage Manager will not be sized correctly with any videos that are playing in the video player, The App Pivot Bar does not hide correctly when playing videos in iOS 16+ due to Old APIs or something else in the App but this version can still get new features from Google like these new ones that were recently added in as an example --> (Shorts, Continue Watching Section, Watch It Again Section, Handles & etc.) so overrall this YouTube Version is still supported by Google. |
