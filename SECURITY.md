# Security Policy for This Repostory
If I verify a reported security vulnerability, my policy is:

- Contributors are allowed to make patches only to the main branch, unless an additional branch is involved. This policy applies to the implementation of custom features/options, updated features/options, and grammar errors.

- uYouPlusExtra does not support Localization pull requests. While it may seem like a sudden change, maintaining localization becomes challenging when the branch needs to be reset due to the changes from qnblackcat/uYouPlus repostory. Therefore, it is difficult to preserve any localization changes that were added on uYouPlusExtra.

- The Users **qnblackcat** and **PoomSmart** are prohibited from utilizing any new code introduced in the uYouPlusExtra fork, but I'll allow you to use any type of submodules and allow you to utize the code you made. but Violation of this rule from the ones I don't allow will result in appropriate consequences, including but not limited to account suspension, access revocation, or other disciplinary actions as deemed necessary by the project administrators. Furthermore, it is strictly forbidden to publicly share or showcase the content of this policy on any social media platforms. Any breach of this restriction may result in similar disciplinary actions. This was policy was made to keep any rejected features on uYouPlusExtra.
